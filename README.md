# SfmlArkanoid
SFML practice. Coding along with Youtube video. Added additional features.

I coded along with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7vSIvLLZi0&list=PLB_ibvUSN7mzUffhiay5g5GUHyJRO4DYr&index=3

Using the SFML Library 2.5.1, 32-bit:

Artwork found on opengameart.org:
Puzzle game graphics by Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl)

You may use these graphics in personal and commercial projects.
Credit (www.kenney.nl) would be nice but is not mandatory.

I added some extra features not included in video:
Game Over text and logic.
Restart feature that rebuilds blocks and resets score.
Score counter/text that counts and accumulates blocks hit.
